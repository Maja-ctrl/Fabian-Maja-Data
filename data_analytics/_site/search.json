      "contents": "\nWhy is this important\nFor effective science communication—to build the population’s trust in scientific findings, it is critical how the information is shared, what information is shared, and finally, who is sharing the information.\nMost scientific experts share potentially crucial information for society’s wealth. However, their communication methods have an enormous impact on science’s credibility and determine its impact on societal behavior.\nTherefore, it is highly important to investigate how people perceive the communication of scientific experts. The Virologist Christian Drosten is a medical expert and has become a celebrity on Twitter during the COVID pandemic. In 2020, he recorded the most significant growth in followers in Germany on the social network.\nBased on this exemplary social network career of Christian Drosten, this project aims to investigate how the german-speaking population perceived the expert’s science communications by analyzing the tweets citing #Drosten between 2020 and 2021.\nResearch Questions\nCan we discover patterns in reactions to the communication of scientific experts using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)?\nIs it possible to detect temporal trends in Twitter reactions to science communication of Christian Drosten using the topics generated from the LDA?\nMethods\nLatent Dirichlet Allocation\nLDA is a generative probabilistic model of a corpus.\nThe basic idea is that documents (here Tweets) are represented as random mixtures over latent topics, where each topic is characterized by a distribution over words.\n\n\n\n\n",
