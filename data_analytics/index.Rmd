## Why is this important 

## Research Questions

The research questions that shall be answered are: 

1. Can we discover patterns in reactions to the communication of scientific experts using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)?  

2. Is it possible to detect temporal trends in Twitter reactions to science communication of Christian Drosten using the topics generated from the LDA?

## method: Latent Dirichlet Allocation

LDA is a generative probabilistic model of a corpus. 

The basic idea is that documents (here Tweets) are represented as random mixtures over latent topics, 
where each topic is characterized by a distribution over words.
