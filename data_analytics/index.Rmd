## Why is this important? 

For **effective science communication**â€”to build the population's trust in scientific findings, it is critical **how** the information is shared, **what** information is shared, and finally, **who** is sharing the information. 

Most scientific experts share potentially crucial information for society's wealth. However, their communication methods have an enormous impact on science's credibility and determine its impact on societal behavior. 

Therefore, it is highly important to investigate how people perceive the communication of scientific experts. The Virologist **Christian Drosten** is a medical expert and has become a celebrity on Twitter during the COVID pandemic. In 2020, he recorded the most significant growth in followers in Germany on the social network. 

Based on this exemplary social network career of Christian Drosten, this project aims to investigate how the german-speaking population perceived the expert's science communications by analyzing the tweets citing **#Drosten** between 2020 and 2021.



## Research Questions

1. Can we discover patterns in reactions to the communication of scientific experts using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)?  

2. Is it possible to detect temporal trends in Twitter reactions to science communication of Christian Drosten using the topics generated from the LDA?

## Methods

**Latent Dirichlet Allocation**

LDA is a generative probabilistic model of a corpus. 

The basic idea is that documents (here Tweets) are represented as random mixtures over latent topics, 
where each topic is characterized by a distribution over words.
