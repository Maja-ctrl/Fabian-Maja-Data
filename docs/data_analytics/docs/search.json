      "contents": "\nWhy is this important?\nDetecting non-human Twitter users has been of interest to academics. Indiana University has developed a free service called Botometer, which scores Twitter handles based on their likelihood of being a Twitterbot. Already in 2009, Twitter bots were estimated to create approximately 24% of tweets on Twitter. One academic study in 2017 estimated that up to 15% of Twitter users were automated bot accounts. And the prevalence of Twitter bots coupled with the ability of some bots to give seemingly human responses has enabled these non-human accounts to garner widespread influence, in both positive and negative ways.\nThis project will address the question whether a specific twitter dataset - consisting of all tweets mentioning #Drosten or @c_drosten in the years 2020 and 2021 - contains bots and how they evolve over time.\nResearch Questions\nWhich percentage of the total number of tweets originate from bots and does this change as the pandemic progresses?\nAre bots and non-bots taking talking in a different valence?\nThe data\n\n\n\nMethods\nBotometer\nStep [x] Process all tweets by using the botometer API: https://botometer.osome.iu.edu\nStep [ ] Interpret the results and find a suited threshold\nStep [ ] Analyse the results: Frequency and distribution over time\nSentiment Analysis\nStep [ ] Perform Sentiment Analysis with the tweets indenified as “bot-like”\nImplications\nThis small project attempts to contribute to the detection of possible bots in a Twitter dataset related to tweets mentioning Christian Drosten using #drosten or @c_drosten. It can provide us with information about the extent to which these Twitter hashtags have been used by bots.\nIn addition, the value of bot tweets can tell us more about the origin and goals of the bots created and provide an answer to the question of whether bots were pushing certain issues.\n\n\n\n",
